# Interstate '76 - add MOUSE driving + Xbox-pad bindings to the ACTIVE input.map.
#
# Research-grounded (see docs/VERIFIED-FIXES.md "Input"):
#  - I76 has NATIVE mouse support: analog channels `mouse Left/Right` (steer) and
#    `mouse Down/Up` (throttle), buttons LeftBtn/RightBtn/MiddleBtn. Exactly three
#    mouse buttons exist in the engine - weapon 4 stays on the keyboard.
#  - The game polls winmm joyGetPosEx (no DirectInput). Wine 10 serves that from
#    any HID pad; this prefix has already enumerated an Xbox Wireless Controller
#    (VID 045E PID 0B20). GOG shipped input.map bound to a phantom "joystick5"
#    (the packager's machine!) - under Wine the first pad is joystick1.
#  - Syntax notes: inside a block, multiple `+` lines form a CHORD (all at once),
#    `- Keyboard Shift` = must-NOT-hold modifier, `- <device> <channel>` in an
#    analog sink = analog source. Alternative bindings = separate blocks.
#  - DO NOT use the in-game Control Configuration menu - community-confirmed
#    append/wrong-device/crash bugs. Edit input.map directly (this script).
#
# All input methods coexist: keyboard stays, mouse + pad are added.
# Pad axes: left stick = steer (X) / throttle (Y) per the game's own
# JOYSTICK.MAP template. If you'd rather throttle on the triggers, change
# "Down/Up" to "Throttle" (winmm Z axis - both triggers share it, resting
# center: RT pushes +, LT pushes -). Probe axes with: wine control joy.cpl
